            <p>15 decade rosary is the only real rosary and should be prayed daily.</p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Begin the Rosary with the <a href="#sign-of-the-cross">Sign of the Cross</a> and the <a href="#apostoles_creed">Apostles' Creed</a>.</li>
                <li>Continue with the <a href="#our-father">Our Father</a>, 3 <a href="#hail-mary">Hail Marys</a>, and <a href="#glory-be">Glory Be</a> on the beads indicated on the diagram above.</li>
                <li>State the first mystery, for example, “The first joyful mystery is the Annunciation.” Pray the <a href="#our-father">Our Father</a>, 10 <a href="#hail-mary">Hail Marys</a>, the <a href="#glory-be">Glory Be</a> and the <a href="#fatima-prayer">Fatima Prayer (“O My Jesus”)</a> while meditating upon this mystery.</li>
                <li>Repeat this for each subsequent mystery.</li>
                <li>At the end of each day’s rosary, say the <a href="#concluding_prayers">Hail, Holy Queen and concluding prayers</a>.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>We highly recommend that all 15 decades of the Rosary be prayed daily, in obedience to the request of Our Lady of Fatima. This is best accomplished by praying a part of the Rosary at different times of the day, for example, the joyful mysteries in the morning, sorrowful mysteries at midday, and glorious mysteries in the evening. The <a href="#hail-holy-queen">Hail, Holy Queen</a> only needs to be prayed at the end of the entire day’s rosary.</p>
            <p>An essential part of the Rosary is meditation on the mysteries, episodes in the life of Our Lord and Our Lady. This means thinking about them, visualizing them, considering the graces and merits displayed in them, and using them for inspiration to better know and love God. It is also common to focus on a particular virtue with each mystery; those recommended by St. Louis de Montfort are given in the following table.</p>
